# Genetic-algorithm-traveling-salesman-problem
Solving travelling salesman problem using an informed search approach called the genetic algorithm. The solution involves the implementation of the following principles of the genetic population:
1. Random Initial Population
2. Mating pool creation using roulette wheel based selection
3. Crossover of the 2 parent genes using 2 indices to generate chile genes
4. Mututation of the gene pool using inversion mutation
5. Elitism - saving the best genes for the next generation
